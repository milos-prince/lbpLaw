      <p>I am a Chartered Arbitrator designated by the ADR Institute of Canada and am an experienced adjudicator in labour, employment, and immigration matters. Many of my decisions have been published across several platforms, including CanLII, CLAD, CarswellNat, and WestLaw. These decisions include grievance and first contract awards and Canada Labour Code matters, among others.</p>
      <p>I have been appointed by agreement to arbitrate diverse grievances pursuant to Collective Agreements throughout Saskatchewan. I am also currently appointed to several tribunals by both the federal and provincial governments including the Immigration and Refugee Board (Immigration Appeal Division), Environmental Protection Tribunal of Canada, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Saskatchewan Victims Compensation Appeal Committee (Chair), and the adjudication roster for occupational health and wage recovery actions pursuant to The Saskatchewan Employment Act.</p>
      <p>I am available for appointments across Canada and am also available to conduct remote or virtual hearings, either by video or teleconference. Presently, due to Covid-19 concerns and restrictions, I have increased my capacity in this regard. Should parties wish to schedule virtual hearings, I am committed to collaboration which will ensure we implement the most suitable process and use the platform most appropriate for the partiesâ€™ needs.</p>
      <p>Confirmation of hearing and cancellation fee structure will be provided upon appointment. My objective is to schedule hearings to be held within 6 months or less and exceed expectations for completing decisions quickly; ideally within 60 days of final submissions.</p>

      <h2>Workplace Investigation</h2>
      <p>During the past decade, I have been retained by several institutional and corporate employers throughout Saskatchewan to conduct external investigations into harassment and discrimination complaints in both unionized and non-unionized workplaces. Some investigations have involved making recommendations for remedies and discipline while others have been limited to fact-finding.</p>
      <p>I am available for and interested in continuing this work, for which I usually charge fees on an hourly or daily basis (for both interviews and report writing) plus out-of-pocket expenses. Rates are negotiable.</p>
